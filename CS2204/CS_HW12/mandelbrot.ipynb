    "## Background\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the most popular mathematical fractals (self-similar patterns at increasingly small scales) is the [Mandelbrot Set](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandelbrot_set). This is a subset of the complex numbers for which a simple iterative computation (executed arbitrary number of times) remains bounded, i.e. produces a finite value within a preset bound. \n",
    "\n",
    "To decide if a complex number ($c$) is inside of the Mandelbrot Set, one evaluates the following iterative computation:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ z_0 = 0 $$\n",
    "$$ z_{n+1} = z_{n}^2 + c $$\n",
    "\n",
    "If the magnitude (absolute value) of $z_n$ ($\\lvert z_n \\rvert$) remains at or below `2`, the original $c$ complex number is inside the set.\n",
    "\n",
    "The popularity of this set is due to the interesting visual patterns, if the the complex values and their set membership are shown on 2D plane. \n",
    "\n",
    "The actual algorithm for generating such and image is relatively simple:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Select a region (`c_topleft`, `c_bottomright`) on the complex plane and the resolution of the image.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Compute the complex grid points based on the region and the resolution.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. For each grid point, execute the iterative algorithm above for `MAX_ITERATION` times. If during the iteration the $\\lvert z_n \\rvert$ value becomes larger than `2`, the point is not in the set\n",
    "\n",
    "4. For each grid point visualize the set membership with a color\n",
    "\n",
    "    Option 1: The pixel is `black` if the corresponding complex value is in the set, otherwise, the pixel is `white`.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Option 2: Use a color scale to visualize the number of steps it took for the the given complex value to cross the threshold of `2`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Try to understand each step, and make sure you provide code solutions and/or text inputs for each `#TODO` item (replacing `#TODO` with your input).**"

    "\n",
    "As you can see, the _real_ parts of the complex numbers are stepped across the columns, while the _imaginary_ parts are swept through the rows. If you have a complex value (or NumPy array with complex values), you can access the _real_ and _imaginary_ parts using the `.real` and `.imag` properties. Also, to build a complex number from two floating point numbers (`a` and `b`, where `b` represents the imaginary part), you can use the `a + 1j * b` expression (notice, that you build the imaginary part by multiplying with `1j`).\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, try to do this experiment with the following example (observe the variables and the final result):\n",

    "y = np.arange(5).reshape((5, 1))\n",
    "x + y\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Obviously, you may want to use `linspace` instead of `arange` and complex/imaginary numbers (instead of the 100 scaling), but this should give you some ideas on how to leverage the broadcasting rules to create a 2D grid."
