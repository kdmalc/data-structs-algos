    "## Background\n",
    "\n",
    "Your professor is conducting a [randomized control trial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trial) to verify the effectiveness of a new wonder supplement ( _Pythonifin_ ) on algorithmic thinking and problem solving. The instructor first seeks [IRB](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Institutional_review_board) approval and he follows the ethical guidelines for human subject research by making the participation completely voluntary, offering no rewards (or punishment) for taking (or not taking) part in the study, and assigning the participants to the treatment (i.e. taking _Pythonifin_ ) and to the control (i.e. taking a placebo) groups completely randomly.\n",
    "\n",
    "By the beginning of the trial 35 students decide to enroll to the study. Since there are 20 doses of _Pythonifin_ are availaable, the professor decides to assing 20 students to the treatment group and the remaining 15 students to the control group. Each test subject is given a pill 30 minutes before taking a test exam (this exam score will not be used in the final semester grade). All tests are evaluated without knowing the group assignments (blind study). The anonymized test scores are shown in the following table:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Pythofinin | Placebo |\n",
    "|------------|---------|\n",
    "|          91|       84|\n",
    "|          87|       92|\n",
    "|          71|       78|\n",
    "|         100|      100|\n",
    "|          91|       82|\n",
    "|          97|       85|\n",
    "|         100|       78|\n",
    "|          80|       87|\n",
    "|         100|      100|\n",
    "|          79|       85|\n",
    "|          83|       93|\n",
    "|          94|       76|\n",
    "|          83|       86|\n",
    "|          79|       89|\n",
    "|          99|       88|\n",
    "|          95|         |\n",
    "|          90|         |\n",
    "|          97|         |\n",
    "|         100|         |\n",
    "|          91|         |\n",
    "\n",
    "While, at first glance, the results show a slight advantage in using _Pythonifin_ , the professor has heard about rigorous significance testing. Unfortunately, he has very limited background in statistical techniques. He decides to do a [permutation test](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resampling_(statistics)#Permutation_tests) to see if the results are significant at a _p value_ of 5%. In a nutshell, he wants to know, that the chance of getting this particular result by accident is less than 5%.\n",
