    "PizzaPy (see Homework 7) has a new competition in town. The NumPie franchise uses aggresive marketing and state of the art machine learning techniques to maximize its growth and revenue. Fresh out of university you are being hired by the new chain to plan the best locations for the new stores. Your benefit package includes a generous all you can eat option (after five years of employment).\n",
    "\n",
    "The preliminary dataset contains the geographical (2D) locations of habitual pizza eaters. Based on this information you will identify the clusters of potential customers and their location centers by implementing the [k-means clustering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-means_clustering) algorithm.\n",
